### Please tell us about an interesting project, preferably outsideof class or work, that two or more of you created together.Include urls if possible.

In 2016, Alex participated in an entrepreneurship contest for teens, organized by Audi, with 2 other classmates. Joan was their mentor and altogether won the contest with a project called Sharge: [http://www.audicrea.com/winners/](http://email.email.ycombinator.com/c/eJwVTUsKwyAUPE1chqhPGxcuuuk1ylOfRDAmqCE9fg0MzIdhJlgAERVLVqF7iVeMBg0XX4lBCcelcAhrBOBaKzHBkkqnWjDPO6bMNisVcOM5N7jgGFBRo3JgiLiDQHpl2W69n5N8T-IzcN_3jFdIvhLO_tifKJVCtQ3Fqt0o52P8YKZfSx5rf1qsWzzPPHxPR2nDNrHw9eHL7al3Cn-tqj_u)

Sharge is a P2P marketplace, based on the sharing economy, that allows members to share their charging stations for electric cars.

The prize of this contest was an entire month in Silicon Valley with Imagine ([https://imagine.cc/silicon-valley/2016](http://email.email.ycombinator.com/c/eJwVjcFuxCAQQ78m3BoFBkj2wGEv-xvVAEMz0oREga3avy-VLFnPsuUcrDXFKQ4O42rWUh740OYTMDsTNZiIdivWau-dmezCtdNdUeYDWdQeICUCTUDORwPrumUPkP0GsaAvHpSEvferTfCczGuID_ziSnNKAxoLp7N-fKMI_Y7ALNqrO-wkco43FPppnPDuczoP1QNe11hg57O2gW30t39_x4N7p_wH_OVBOw)) to further develop this project.

First, there is an app based solution, where owners can list their charging stations and drivers can book them.

On the other hand, to improve the customer experience, we also created a device called Sharger. This device is plugged into the outlet and connects the charging station to the Internet (IoT) to know its availability and to verify drivers through NFC. Only the driver who has booked and paid will be able to access the Sharger by bringing closer the mobile.

The Sharger has also a display that shows relevant information to the user like wrong access or kilobytes per hour thanks to a controller.

We even consider a new way to use the Sharger with Apple Car Play. As the car is also connected to the internet through a SIM card, the location is always known, so when the car will be arriving at the booked charging station, the Sharger will open automatically.

Finally, since selling energy between peers is illegal in Spain we explore the possibility to use Blockchain to make possible all these transactions between users and create a pure P2P experience. In this way, payments will be autonomous and more transparent. That’s also how we started being involved with blockchain technology.

### How long have the founders known one another and how did you meet?Have any of the founders not met in person?

Alex and Pol have known each other for more than 6 years. When they were 13 they created a platform to help students with their homework and being efficient with their time. We love this video ([https://youtu.be/XbRhefn_26M](http://email.email.ycombinator.com/c/eJwVjT0LwyAURX9NHEN8aj4Ghy7dunTqFp5RUTAa4gu0_74GLtxzhsu1WkrwikWt0Ewweb_gwmEVaBUYLsCgnL2UfBwVdHKImdyZMfU7xsSC5oOyg5o4woZTA3sP-OZRjE5II1nSgeionXh08Gz5lYuu3riGH_MOzucVxhc7dXAplfaAyX1r3PCkfis7I43HkZpTLLk2rTDw-e7L7JHI2T8Amj0y)) from a Spanish news channel.

As we already explained in the previous question, Alex and Joan have known each other in an entrepreneurship contest. Back in 2016, they won the Audi Creativity Challenge with Sharge and this allowed them to go to Silicon Valley for a month as part of the Imagine Creativity Center. It was an amazing experience where they learned a lot and it was also where Alex and Joan discovered that they really like to work together.

Joan met David when they were 12, they are 34 now, so it has been a while. They played basketball together and have been friends ever since. In addition, David helped Joan at the beginning of his Airbnb for parking spaces (Parkinghood) and now they are working together part-time and remote on expanding Landing.jobs (tech jobs marketplace) to Spain.

We all came together to form a balanced team, with relevant experience, including blockchain, corporate and startup founder experience.

We all have face to face meetings very often.

## Progress

### How far along are you?

Right now we have launched the Alpha version 0.3. This is a usable version of our product which is already using IPFS.

We have some known flaws, as well as pending additional functionalities. That's why we have our Backlog on Trello and we are working on continuously to make the current version more robust and also launch a new version soon with new features.

More information about our previous versions:
[https://github.com/FileNation/FileNation/releases/](http://email.email.ycombinator.com/c/eJxdjbkOwyAQRL_GlBEs4KOgSOMyvxAtV4y0PmTWUj4_uI000swrZiY6YyBbUZxFP8CQ84STgrfGaMErDR7NmI1RfW-hM7JsnM4N6bFiIbG4Xk7jIK0f86CNltpICL7XNiJMPkAU5Bbmo3b62cHc9Cm8XP4R9rXBXCi9kMu-_cOZKGFNtUVxuiUR7e0dKX1rCXjyPSDY4XFQ47tUG1aQarz98mthTvEH9glGqg)

### How long have each of you been working on this? Have you been part-time or full-time? Please explain.

The project started in Codeworks, the leading JavaScript Bootcamp in Europe. Thanks to Joan’s connection with Codeworks through Landing.jobs, Alex got a scholarship and he took the course during Summer 2017 (June-August).

There he could learn about JavaScript, Node.js, React & Redux, AngularJS, Polymer, Scrum, TDD, etc. but also about specific blockchain technologies which he was already passionate about like IPFS, Ethereum, Solidity or Hyperledger. Alex needed to apply those technologies to create a final project and that was the first seed of FileNation (September 2017).

It was not until January when the team was officially created and FileNation was born. We worked part-time during the last 3 months, but the plan is for us to be working 100% starting this Summer. Here you have each specific situation:

\- Alex: works every day on the project. He is finishing high school in a couple of months (mandatory by law) and he is allowed to skip some classes to work on the project. Alex is eager to finish high school in May to fully focus on the project.

\- Joan: he is remotely working part-time for Landing.jobs as a freelance leading the Spanish market but he has full flexibility. Now he is working part-time on FileNation but he will join full-time during the summer.

\- Pol: he is currently studying Data Science and Engineering at UPC Barcelona. Invests class time and full afternoons to work on FileNation.

\- David: he left the corporate world at the end of 2017 to become an entrepreneur and joined FileNation soon after. Right now he just started working remotely and part-time for Landing Jobs with Joan.

### Which of the following best describes your progress?

Public Beta

### How many active users or customers do you have?  If you have some particularly valuable customers, who are they?

Let us share our metrics during the last 3 months:

January → Visitors 764 / Sessions 1.054
February → Visitors 860 / Sessions 1.138
March (until 24th) → Visitors 637 / Sessions 904

At this point, we do not have a registration
step, but since March 8th we are tracking events using Google Analytics
and we know we had 215 active users since then. Taking into account that
 we had 433 visitors since we implement event tracking, we have a
Conversion of around 50%.
On the other hand, we already had some valuable testers that have
used our product and have provided us really useful feedback. Here you
have some examples:

David Dias - Core Team at IPFS
Victor Bjelkholm - Core team at IPFS
Luis Cuende - Project Lead at Aragon
Jorge Izquierdo - Tech Lead at Aragon
Xavier Verdaguer - Founder of Imagine Creativity Center
Yolanda Perez - Banc Sabadell BStartup Director

### Do you have revenue?

No

### Anything else you would like us to know regarding your revenue or growth rate?

At this moment, we are not focused on revenue or growth. Instead, we are focused on building a valuable product.

That’s why we are making our current version more stable based on the feedback we get from our users. For that reason, apart from asking some key experts to test our product, we also have a chat tool (Drift) installed on our site and we are constantly interacting with our users.

In order to investigate the B2B approach, we are currently contacting companies trying to schedule meetings to see how our product can be valuable for them and which features we should prioritize.

### How much money do you spend per month?

200

### How much money does your company have in the bank now?

12000

### How long is your runway?

(e.g. 5 months)

6 months (without considering external investment)

### If you've applied previously with the same idea, how much progress have you madesince the last time you applied? Anything change?

We have not applied before with the same idea.

### If you have already participated or committed to participatein an incubator, "accelerator" or "pre-accelerator" program,please tell us about it.

We have not participated or committed to participate in an incubator, accelerator or pre-accelerator.

## Idea

### Why did you pick this idea to work on?  Do you have domain expertisein this area?  How do you know people need what you're making?

As we explained previously, Alex started getting involved with Blockchain in the project Sharge. After that, he was selected as one of the Forbes 30 Under 30 list on the technology category. He took this opportunity to connect with key people involved in the blockchain ecosystem, more specifically, in IPFS.

After discovering the potential behind blockchain, he wanted to create a product based on distributed technologies. That’s why he decided to attend the Codeworks Bootcamp and learn everything he needed to achieve this mission.

In the meantime, Pol also was involved in this process and started hacking in the blockchain space with Alex. They came up with a bunch of concepts. They took those concepts to hackathons and presented some of the ideas in front of some key groups in the decentralized tech ecosystem. ([https://www.meetup.com/codeworksbcn/events/241357353/](http://email.email.ycombinator.com/c/eJwVjs2KxCAQhJ8mHsPYttE5eNjLvMbS_hFZoyH2bPbx14GCqq-goKJDhKxFcZq8AZPzk54SvhVFDV4q8IQ2I8pt07DgozROV6O6HlSq2J2xwRoPXkUiC1YmRLNliGRzJMAsqtuZz7GorwVeU_d9r0dK_D7X0I9ZhB7T3a-f4UObmH5T4zEDoFTaKK1mFpfbU619HqCa_kYJdPFnL9jRedbJXHobEwc8pP342x-FOcV_JtxHjA)). One of this ideas finally evolved to FileNation.

We really think blockchain and distributed technologies are going to be an important part of the future and we wanted to build something based on these technologies, but especially something that could be useful for many people and solve a real need.

In David’s experience, people struggle to share files at work and in many cases have to look for alternative solutions like WeTransfer, which are in many cases not accepted by companies due to lack of security mostly.

People are already using traditional products like the one we are making, so we think by extending the functionalities taking profit of these new technologies and making it accessible to companies, we can build a product people want to pay for.

### What's new about what you're making?  What substitutes do peopleresort to because it doesn't exist yet (or they don't know about it)?

We want to be the go-to tool for sharing files. Besides making file sharing simple and improving existing capabilities we want to provide users with extra features, by making files behave differently based on certain parameters or actions.

There is a huge potential connected to Smart Files and we still have a lot to explore, but in order to understand the concept in an easy way, let us share a simple example.

Right now we are sharing photos on social networks and those photos remain the same after they have been posted. Imagine now that these photos could change depending on some actions. For example, if a photo receives a “Like” on Instagram, it changes to another photo for some seconds. Or imagine a photo that changes after receiving a determined number of likes.

The last example is more focused on B2C but the concept of Smart Files can also be used by companies in a B2B approach. Imagine files only being accessible at a certain location or at a certain time, content in files can be blurred as per the sender's input, file tracking, file locking, etc.

We can also play with IPFS, Ethereum and IPLD to explore the Smart Files Concept.

We are considering having our own desktop app to send and manage smart files. Including a dashboard where users will be able to create different types of smart files. Apart from that, we also want to include these functionalities to existing email tools, as we want to streamline the process as much as possible.

### Who are your competitors, and who might become competitors? Who do youfear most?

Our competitors range from a USB manufacturer to WeTransfer since they are also solving the need of sharing files.

Other services like DropBox, Box, Google Drive or OneDrive are also potential competitors. Even they are more focused on storage, they could also become direct competitors and develop similar features.

As we want to go one step forward from the traditional players, we need to pay close attention to products in the blockchain realm, that could potentially end up providing similar extended services as we plan to do. A clear example of this would be Filecoin which is also based on IPFS.

### What do you understand about your business that other companies in itjust don't get?

We explore the implications of IPFS (the Distributed Web) to FileNation in the context of freedom of expression and privacy, in which companies take it seriously.

We believe it is possible to go beyond simply sharing standard files and improve based on providing more capacity to share, making your site prettier and empowering freedom of expression. We want to add functionalities to the existing process, to provide additional value never seen before.

### How do or will you make money?  How much could you make?

(We realize you can't know precisely, but give your best estimate.)

We are considering two monetization options:

\- B2B: Freemium SaaS that would allow companies to simply send files in a more secure and efficient way. Companies will pay based on plans depending on the functionalities and number of users. As we are using IPFS, our product aim to be more efficient than WeTransfer, so our plan for business will be less than $10/month, but honestly we don’t know yet how much exactly and which features will be included in the free version and which one in the paying version.

\- Smart Files: apart from Freemium SaaS approach, we also think there are a lot of potential streams of revenue connected to the usage of Smart Files. In this case, will be more of a Pay per Use approach.

\- On-site ads: like WeTransfer we can also let companies make some campaigns in the background of our home page of FileNation.

We don’t know yet the answer to “How much could you make?”, but we do know that more than 40 million people today are using the traditional products to transfer their files and more than 1000 million files are sent every month.

Right now, we are focused on developing a product that will be valuable for this 40 million people.

### How will you get users?  If your idea is the type that faces achicken-and-egg problem in the sense that it won't be attractiveto users till it has a lot of users (e.g. a marketplace, a datingsite, an ad network), how will you overcome that?

Until now we have used the following channels to get users:

\- Medium ([https://medium.com/filenation](http://email.email.ycombinator.com/c/eJwVjUsKxCAQRE8Tl4O2bWIWLmYz1xjaHxE0CbEDc_wxUFA86kFFhwjZiOIM-QWWnFdaFXw1RQNeafCENiOqeTYwoSw7p2un-mpUqticxjQGHVa0UhsZF8RgvdQBNUA0UVS3MZ990u8JPiMtxXK3VzjagFxq2onLsYvLbanWY1xQTb9eAl38WIIdnWcd_Gh9YAep7NO3b4U5xT8hDz2j)):
 we have already published 5 posts in our Medium blog and it helped us
to get noticed in the blockchain community. Especially, one of the
posts, since it received more than 3k claps.
\- Hacker News: we were number 1 for two entire days ([https://bit.ly/2updmyv](http://email.email.ycombinator.com/c/eJwVjEEOgyAQRU8jSyPDgLhg0U2v0QwFIgkqkbGpty9NfvLe2_zgECFpkZ0mP8Oc0kKLhJeioMFLBZ7QJkRpjIYBp7xzPHcq40a5iNVpC7NCsCEFmCzqWVorg0HUKNH4RRS3Mtc2qMcAzz6feSx3F7hq2O6PON0aSzn6N5X4bflNJ4_vYxPsqNbSm_Oxt54NJmn_vPyWmWP4AS9ZOj0)). This helped us to see that there was an interest in the tech community and also brought us interesting alpha testers.
\- Media: since Alex is a Forbes under 30, he is quite well known in
the local ecosystem and he is being contacted by a lot of journalists
for interviews. Alex always speak about FileNation in those interviews.

All the previous strategies are basically to bring us alpha testers. We are aware that first, we need to have a great product (that people want) before investing in marketing and sales. But in the future, when we have a product valuable enough, we want to establish several acquisition channels:

\- Referrals: users can get discounts inviting other users
\- Inbound
\- SEO
\- Google Adwords
\- Paid ads on social networks

In terms of B2B, we are also aware that implies a bigger cost in sales. Once we confirm our product is valuable for companies we will invest resources in having a sales team to acquire companies.

## Equity

### Have you incorporated, or formed any legal entity (like an LLC) yet?

No

### If you have not formed the company yet, describe the planned equityownership breakdown among the founders, employees and any other proposed stockholders.

## Others

### If you had any other ideas you considered applying with, pleaselist them. One may be something we've been waiting for. Often when wefund people it's to do something they list here and not in the mainapplication.

\- Sharge (already explained in one of the previous questions)
\- New File Format (.fn). Like .gif but for smart files.
\- CypherEstate: a decentralized, non-censurable publishing platform
for hackers, cypherpunks and journalists. We thought about it as a “The
decentralized Medium”. CypherEstate was built in under 36h on top of
IPFS and won the Everis track of the HackUPC MLH hackathon. (there were
more than 700 hackers).
\- Secreat: surprise dinners for couples. Based on some criteria

(The answer need not be related to your project.)

The team discovered that David had a tattoo in his back. The team participated in a European startup related hackatrain called Imagine Express.

David had to do a pitch to sell himself and the rest of the team decided that the best way was to do a striptease on stage, he was not convinced at all, but took one for the team. That’s when the team learned that David got a tattoo after leaving the corporate world. We can show you, just do not tell him. Actually we have a video of the pitch :)

### What convinced you to apply to Y Combinator?

As we have a blockchain product, we considered going for an ICO for a while, this sounded like a good way of getting funds, but we ended up realizing, that this was not going to make FileNation better right away.

We are product-enthusiasts, we want to make something that people use and solve issues, rather than spending a lot of time trying to convince individuals to invest on us. We prefer to start working on making an excellent product. After we set our priorities straight, it was easy to make the decision and apply to YC.

### How did you hear about Y Combinator?

Well, considering YCombinator is the best way you can make your startup better, we cannot even remember how we heard about you, but we did a long time ago. In addition one of our co-founders, Joan, applied some years ago for his startup Parkinghood.
